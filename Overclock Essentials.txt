This is now deprecated as Sinclar uses auto adaptive over clocking. 

Check what is your actual stable stock clock 
vcgencmd measure_clock arm 
Check temps on stock heatsink or with fan 
vcgencmd measure_temp 

If temps are under 50 degrees C then step up a notch 
sudo nano /boot/config.txt 
Paste after the first line 
over_voltage=2
arm_freq=1750

Check temps again <br/>
vcgencmd measure_temp or watch -n 2 vcgencmd measure_temp 

If temps stay under 50 then you can step up to 2.0 Ghz 
over_voltage=5
arm_freq=2000

Be sure to use a quality power cable and power delivery capable brick and not the shipped one as it will not be able to deliver correct amperes and volrages. 

Never let your Raspberry Pi 4 run at high temps as it will reduce the life.
