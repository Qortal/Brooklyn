===============================================================================
* This build is optimized for the core version 3.3.x and onwards. Welcome abroad Digibyte and Raven
* You two projects will feel comfortable now on Torchie
* The entire system is now arm64 instead of previous hard float 64 release (kern,userspace) for ARRR chain support.
* Brooklyn Torchie The Cat 5.80.11 is here. meh! (First ever release on the planet to use ARM Turbo Clocks & full ARM NEON Crypto Engine)

This release brings more optimizations to QortalOS. Too many to name in a single README.

* Because there is a moose on the loose!! His name is Seany. He is going in da mool buff!

  > Furthermore, made the image "crowetic proof" so he wont fuck it up like every single time. Bitch be trippin -_-
  
Note for titanMATE: sudo loginctl and check a "c" session if you have problem loggin in on RDP. Kill presistant logged sessions with "sudo loginctl terminate-session cX" where X is the session number.
Example: 

[pi@titan:~/qortal]$ sudo loginctl
SESSION  UID USER SEAT TTY
      6 1000 pi        pts/0 (Do not terminate this session as its a term login)
     c4 1000 pi        Safe to terminate.

Use logout from MATE Desktop to prevent locked screen sessions in the first place.

If you rely heavily on VPN to bypass your regional filters then it will be a good idea to have extra entropy in hand. Any OpenSource Entropy stick should work on Brooklyn from now.

Note: Use raspi-config to setup your wifi or add plamsa desktop network manager with "sudo apt install plasma-nm" . It is assumed that you  will be using an ethernet/network cable or keyboard and mouse to setup and configure your desktop. For headless image, you only need SSH access to your hardwired device. If you are facing Link Not Ready message still then simply reboot your Brooklyn device after doing a "sudo apt purge openresolv dhcpcd5". 

You can get a release and flash it directly on your USB 3 hard drive with Balena Etcher. The default image size is meant for a 32GB microSD card. If you have a bigger microSD card then after login do a "sudo raspi-config", head over to Advacned and resize the file system. Same can be done for a GPT partitioned USB 3 hard drive/SSD. Keep in mind that MBR drives have a size limit per block partition. For 4TB or bigger drive you might want to use GPT instead. If you have purchased a Raspberry Pi 4 elsewhere then you might have to flash the boot loader to do a mass storaeg boot. Ask The Moose on the loose for help (better not as he won'g give a fuck anyways).

Pro Tip: Do not add another Desktop overlay or replace the current with something else. It will make the system unstable and unreliable. What comes pre-shipped with the packaged image is built around the kernel and whatever else was done with it. Be smart, don't be a crowetic. LMAO!

Legacy QortalOS Linux Kernel 5.60.14
====================================

This thing is way ahead of kernel.org releases for a reason. Go figure...

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
