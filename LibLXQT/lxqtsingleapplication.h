 *  \brief The SingleApplication class provides an single instance Application.
 *
 *  This class allows the user to create applications where only one instance
 *  is allowed to be running at an given time. If the user tries to launch
 *  another instance, the already running instance will be activated instead.
 *
 *  The user has to set the activation window with setActivationWindow. If it
 *  doesn't the second instance will quietly exit without activating the first
 *  instance window. In any case only one instance is allowed.
 *
 *  These classes depend on D-Bus and KF5::WindowSystem
