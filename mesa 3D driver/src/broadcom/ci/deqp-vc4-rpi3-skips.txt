# Conformance issue: VC4 needs dynamic loops in the VS to cause a
# shader link failure.
#
# The issue is that the HW doesn't have an exec mask at dispatch
# for the VS, so the shouldn't-be-exec channels have undefined
# contents and may cause infinite loops, leading to GPU hangs.  The
# process of GPU hang reset causes flakes in whatever other jobs are
# running simultaneously, so we can't even leave these in the flakes
# list for tracking.
