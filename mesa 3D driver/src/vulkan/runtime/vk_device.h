       * In this mode, timeline semaphores are still technically an emulation
       * in the sense that they don't support wait-before-signal natively.
       * Instead, all GPU-waitable objects support a CPU wait-for-pending
       * operation which lets the userspace driver wait until a given event
       * on the (possibly shared) vk_sync is pending.  The event is "pending"
       * if a job has been submitted to the kernel (possibly from a different
       * process) which will signal it.  In vkQueueSubit, we use this wait
       * mode to detect waits which are not yet pending and, the first time we
       * do, spawn a thread to manage the queue.  That thread waits for each
       * submit's waits to all be pending before submitting to the driver
       * queue.
       *
       * We have to be a bit more careful about a few things in this mode.
       * In particular, we can never assume that any given wait operation is
       * pending.  For instance, when we go to export a sync file from a
       * binary semaphore, we need to first wait for it to be pending.  The
       * spec guarantees that the vast majority of these waits return almost
       * immediately, but we do need to insert them for correctness.
