# Note: skips lists for CI are just a list of lines that, when
# non-zero-length and not starting with '#', will regex match to
# delete lines from the test list.  Be careful.

# Note normal pre-merge CI also includes -premerge-skips.txt, and that's where
# "it's slow but would pass/fail/crash within a couple of minutes" skips should go.
