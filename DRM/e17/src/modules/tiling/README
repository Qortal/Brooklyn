A tiling module for the Enlightenment Window Manager

Concept
=======

Each desktop can have from 1 to 8 (vertical) columns.
Windows are then resized and moved to use as much as columns as configured.

When there are more windows than possible columns, the remaining windows are
packed in the last column.

Resizing or moving a window will try to resize or move the column it is in.
