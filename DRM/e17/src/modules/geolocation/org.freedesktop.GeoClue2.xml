      org.freedesktop.GeoClue2.Manager:
      @short_description: The GeoClue service manager

      This is the interface you use to talk to main GeoClue2 manager object at
      path "/org/freedesktop/GeoClue2/Manager". The only thing you do with this
      interface is to call org.freedesktop.GeoClue2.Manager.GetClient() on it
      to get your application specific client object.

      This is the interface you use to retrieve location information and receive
