	 * Add backend private data. This would be for the backend
	 * to do all additional imports it might ever use in advance.
	 * The basic principle, even if not implemented in drivers today,
	 * is that dmabufs are first attached, but the actual allocation
	 * is deferred to first use. This would allow the exporter and all
	 * attachers to agree on how to allocate.
	 *
	 * The DRM backend would use this to create drmFBs for each
	 * dmabuf_buffer, just in case at some point it would become
	 * feasible to scan it out directly. This would improve the
	 * possibilities to successfully scan out, avoiding compositing.
