# The Arm NN TensorFlow Lite delegate

'armnnDelegate' is a library for accelerating certain TensorFlow Lite operators on Arm hardware by providing
the TensorFlow Lite interpreter with an alternative implementation of the operators via its delegation mechanism.

For more information, like a list of supported operators, please visit our [doxygen documentation](https://arm-software.github.io/armnn/latest/delegate.xhtml).
