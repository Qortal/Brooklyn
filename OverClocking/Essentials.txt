Check what is your actual stable stock clock <br/>
vcgencmd measure_clock arm <br/>
Check temps on stock heatsink or with fan <br/>
vcgencmd measure_temp <br/>

If temps are under 50 degrees C then step up a notch <br/>
sudo nano /boot/config.txt <br/>
Paste after the first line <br/>
over_voltage=2
arm_freq=1750

Check temps again <br/>
vcgencmd measure_temp or watch -n 2 vcgencmd measure_temp <br/>

If temps stay under 50 then you can step up to 2.0 Ghz <br/>
over_voltage=5
arm_freq=2000

Be sure to use a power delivery brick and not the shipped one as it will not be able to deliver correct amperes and volrages. <br/>

Never let your Raspberry Pi 4 run at high temps as it will reduce the life. <br/>
